# Image Setup Instructions

To complete the Casa Zii landing page, you need to add the following images to the `public` folder:

## Required Images:

1. **`beach-hero.jpg`** - The beach scene with waves and palm trees
   - Should be placed in: `public/beach-hero.jpg`
   - Recommended dimensions: 1280x630px or similar aspect ratio
   - The HeroSection component is already configured to use this image

2. **Logo** - The CASA zii logo (optional, currently using text-based logo)
   - If you want to use an image logo instead of the text-based one
   - Should be placed in: `public/logo.png` or `public/logo.svg`
   - Update the Logo component to use the image instead of text

## Current Status:
- ✅ All components are implemented with pixel-perfect styling
- ✅ Courier Prime font is loaded and applied
- ✅ Exact measurements and colors from your CSS specifications
- ⏳ Waiting for beach-hero.jpg to be added to public folder

## Next Steps:

2. Run `npm run dev` to see the complete landing page
3. Test the responsive design on different screen sizes
